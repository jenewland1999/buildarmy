# Buildarmy

Previously a WordPress and WooCommerce website, Buildarmy has been transformed into a headless e-commerce store utilising a modern open-source stack. Through hybrid rendering techniques and a decoupled architecture, the project achieves its goals of improved core web vitals and a better end-user experience for customers. Designed and developed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of BSc (Hons) Computing (Software Engineering) at The University of Northampton.
